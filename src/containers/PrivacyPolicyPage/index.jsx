          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to any website, application, feature,
            widget or other online service that is owned or controlled by
            Amapola Escarlata Online, Inc., ("Amapola Escarlata"), that posts a
            link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Channels") and by
            Amapola Escarlata offline. By accessing, using, or otherwise
            interacting with any part of our Channels, or by otherwise providing
            Personal Information to Amapola Escarlata, you agree to be bound by
            the terms of this Policy and the applicable Terms of Use which
            govern your use of any Channel. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF
            THIS POLICY AND THE APPLICABLE TERMS OF USE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE
            THE CHANNELS OR PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US THROUGH ANY
            CHANNEL. KEY POINTS Please review our full Privacy Policy below
            before using our Channels, but here is a summary of some important
            information: How Does Amapola Escarlata Use the Information it
            Collects? When we collect or receive information about our users and
            customers, we primarily use this information in connection with your
            relationship with Amapola Escarlata, including making it possible
            for you to use the features of our Channels and to provide you with
            special offers and content we think will most interest you. When you
            shop with us or interact with us through one of our Channels, we
            share information with our sister companies. We will use this
            information to better understand our customers and improve your
            shopping and browsing experience. Other brands may also contact you
            with marketing information, such as special offers and promotions.
            If you would prefer that we not make your Personal Information
            available to our sister and other companies for their own direct
            marketing purposes. Does Amapola Escarlata Share Information with
            Other Third Parties? While we share non-Personal Information we
            collect (such as information about how visitors interact with our
            Channels and hashed or de-identified information) with third parties
            in our discretion, we share Personal Information only as described
            in our full Privacy Policy, below. So long as you consent, we share
            Personal Information with third parties so that they can market
            products and services to you, with service providers that help us
            operate the Channels, with the issuing bank that provides our
            co-branded credit cards, in the event of a corporate restructuring,
            and as required by law. How Does Amapola Escarlata Work with
            Third-Party Analytics and Advertising Companies? We work with online
            advertising and analytics providers to serve our ads online and
            provide us with information regarding traffic on the Channels. The
            companies with which we work may use information about your
            activities on the Channels - and other websites and services you
            visit across the various devices you use - to recognize you and your
            devices across the internet and to provide you targeted advertising
            based upon your interests. Some of these companies participate in
            self-regulatory programs that allow you to opt-out of having
            information about you used for targeted advertising purposes, and
            you may access those opt-outs at optout.networkadvertising.org and
            optout.aboutads.info . Please note these mechanisms will not stop
            you from seeing ads while you are online. If you opt-out, you will
            see generic ads instead of ads targeted to your interests. What if I
            am a Resident of California? If you are a resident of California,
            please see “Your California Privacy Rights.” INFORMATION WE COLLECT
            Through various features on the Channels, we may collect personal
            information, which is information that is linked to a specific,
            identifiable individual ("Personal Information"), such as first and
            last name, email addresses, postal addresses, and telephone numbers.
            We may also collect other information about you, such as payment
            card data or other payment information, information about your
            purchases and other transactions with us, demographic information
            (e.g., your gender, ZIP code/postal code, or similar information),
            information about the device you are using to access the Channels,
            and information about your preferences and interests. We may also
            offer features through which you may choose to provide us with
            information that may be considered to include biometric identifiers
            (e.g., imaging used to help fit clothing). We may take your Personal
            Information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by
            combining it with information about other individuals and/or by
            hashing the information or otherwise removing characteristics that
            make the information personally identifiable directly to you. If we
            combine demographic, preference or similar information with the
            Personal Information we collect, we will treat the combined
            information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. The
            information we collect may be provided by you or by a third party,
            or may be collected automatically. We may combine the information we
            collect online with information we collect in our stores or
            elsewhere offline. Our Channels are intended for a general audience
            and are not intended for use by or targeted to children younger than
            the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from
            children younger than the age of 13. If we learn that we have
            inadvertently collected Personal Information from a user who is
            younger than age 13, we will delete that information from our active
            databases. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child
            younger than 13 and believe that we have inadvertently collected
            Personal Information from your child, please contact us using the
            information in the "Contact Us" section below. Information You
            Provide. We may ask you to provide certain information to us
            (including your Personal Information) when you use the Channels or
            offline. For example, you may give us your information when making a
            purchase or completing another transaction, joining our affiliate
            program, interacting with customer service (including live chat),
            and through interactive features. When interacting with customer
            service, you may have the option to allow our representatives to
            share your screen. If you choose to permit screen sharing, we may be
            able to view any data and applications present on your device screen
            at that time. You may choose not to provide certain information;
            however, choosing to do so may prevent you from being able to take
            advantage of some of our offered features or from conducting
            transactions. Community Forums and User Submission. The Channels may
            provide you the opportunity to submit information to us, through
            interactive features, and through other communication functionality
            ("Community Forums"). You may choose, through such features or
            otherwise, to submit or post "User Submissions" (which means any and
            all information and content that you submit or post to the Channels,
            including, without limitation, photos, audio, video, messages, text,
            files, or other content you provide us and as further described in
            our Terms of Use). Some features, such as user reviews, may be
            operated by a third party and your postings also may be subject to
            the third party's privacy policy and terms of use. Please note that
            certain information, such as your name and/or place of residence,
            may be publicly displayed on the Channels along with your User
            Submissions. Your use of any Community Forum is subject to our Terms
            of Use including without limitation the "User-Generated
            Communications" section. Note that anything you submit through a
            public-facing Community Forum may be made public - others will have
            access to your User Submission and may use it or share it with third
            parties. We are not responsible for the actions of third parties and
            the use of your information and other User Submissions by such third
            parties is not subject to the protections of this Privacy Policy.
            Social Networking Features Functionality on the Channels may permit
            interactions that you initiate between the Channels and a
            third-party service such as Facebook ("Social Networking Features").
            Examples of Social Networking Features include enabling you to
            "like" or "share" content from the Channels or to "like" or "share"
            our page on a third-party service; to automatically or selectively
            show your social media posts on the Channels; and to otherwise
            connect the Channels to a third-party service. If you choose to
            share content or to otherwise post information through the Channels
            to a third-party service, or vice versa, that information may be
            publicly displayed. Similarly, if you post information on a
            third-party service that references us (for example, by using a
            hashtag associated with us in your post), your post may be published
            on the Channels or otherwise in accordance with the terms of that
            third party. Also, both we and the third party may have access to
            certain information about you and your use of the Channels and the
            third-party service. In addition, we may receive information about
            you if other users of a third-party service give us access to their
            profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about
            you is otherwise accessible through your profile or similar page on
            a social networking or other third-party service. The information we
            collect in connection with Social Networking Features is subject to
            this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the
            third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices,
            including whether the third party continues to share information
            with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with
            regard to what is visible to others on that third-party service. If
            you submit User Submissions or use Social Networking Features, we
            may publish that information or content online or offline, including
            in connection with our advertising, marketing, publicity, and
            promotional activities, as further described in our Terms of Use.
            Information Provided by Third Parties We may obtain information,
            including Personal Information and demographic information, about
            you from third parties, including our joint marketing partners,
            third-party websites, affiliate program service providers, the bank
            that operates our private label credit card program, users who
            provide us with information about others (i.e. purchasing a gift
            card for someone else), or other unrelated third parties. We may
            combine information about you that we have with information we
            obtain from business partners or other companies. In those cases, we
            will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information. Please
            note that if you apply for or utilize a Amapola Escarlata branded
            credit card, you are providing your information to the bank that
            administers the credit card, which will share that information with
            us. Send-to-a-Friend Features. We may make available on the Channels
            a "send-to-a-friend," "refer a friend," "wishlist" or similar
            function that permits you to send Channel content directly to a
            third party through the Channels. If you send a friend a
            communication using such functionality, the information you provide
            about your friend (e.g., name and e-mail address) is used to
            facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing
            purpose unless we obtain consent from that person. Information the
            Channels Automatically Collect When You Interact with Us. Amapola
            Escarlata and our third-party service providers, including analytics
            providers, advertisers, and third-party content providers, may
            automatically or passively receive and record certain information
            about your use of the Channels whenever you visit or interact with
            the Channels, such as: your IP address, mobile device identifier, or
            similar device identifier; browser type; type of device you use to
            access the Channels; the domain name from which you arrived at the
            Channels; the time of day you visit our Channels; Location Data
            (defined below); and specific pages or areas of the Channel through
            which you navigate and how you interact with those pages or areas
            ("Usage Information"). This information helps us create a better
            experience for our users and provide you with targeted advertising.
            Please see the "Online Advertising and Analytics Providers" section
            below for more information about how to control the use of your
            Personal Information for the purposes of advertising. We may capture
            and record or infer certain location data regarding your use of the
            Channels and your travels ("Location Data"). We may link that
            Location Data to other information that you provide to us or that
            may be accessed in connection with your use of the Channels. We may
            directly collect precise Location Data from the device you use to
            access the Channels if you have opted-in to such collection through
            our mobile application or your browser. You may be able to turn off
            the collection of precise Location Data through your device
            settings. However, please note that we may still be able to infer
            your approximate location through other information we collect, such
            as IP address. The methods used to collect Usage Information may
            include: Cookies and Local Storage. "Cookies" and local storage are
            pieces of information (data files) transferred to an individual's
            browser on their device when the device is used to visit a Channel.
            These technologies are able to store a unique identifier for a
            device to allow a certain Internet site to recognize the device
            whenever the device is used to visit the site. These technologies
            may be used for many purposes by us and our third-party service
            providers, such as automatically collecting Usage Information,
            enabling features, remembering your preferences, and providing you
            with targeted advertising elsewhere online. If you do not want to
            accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your
            Internet browser. You can find more information about cookies and
            how they work at www.allaboutcookies.org. Certain browsers or
            browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash, may provide additional local
            data storage mechanisms that are used in a manner similar to
            cookies, and some of the content included on our Channels may make
            use of this local storage. For example, a Flash cookie is a data
            file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be
            built into or downloaded by you onto your device. Flash cookies may
            be used for various purposes, including, without limitation,
            enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences. For more
            information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit
            http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.
            If you choose to disable cookies, to adjust your Flash privacy
            settings on your device, or to otherwise restrict local storage,
            some features of the Channels may not function properly, including
            the shopping cart and ordering processes. Web Beacons. Small graphic
            images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known
            as "pixel tags," "1x1 GIFs," or "clear GIFs") may be included in our
            web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you,
            but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into
            a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar
            technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including,
            without limitation, to count visitors to a Channel, to monitor how
            users navigate the Channel, to count how many emails that were sent
            were actually opened or to count how many particular links were
            actually viewed. Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming
            code that is designed to collect information about your interactions
            with the Channels, such as the links you click on. The code is
            temporarily downloaded onto your device from our server or a
            third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected
            to a Channel, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. In addition,
            we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar
            information for security and fraud detection purposes. OUR USE OF
            INFORMATION We may use information collected from or about you,
            including your Personal Information and Usage Information, to: ·
            allow you to participate in the Channels, or features or activities
            we offer, including sweepstakes, contests, or other prize
            promotions; · process a transaction (through our Channels or in our
            stores) or your account registration, verify your identity or
            eligibility, and send you confirmations and receipts; · send you
            information and special offers from us, our advertisers, or
            third-party business partners; to contact you regarding any problems
            with your merchandise order or account; and to respond to your
            inquiries and provide customer service related to your use of the
            Channels; · administer and manage our affiliate program, through
            which third parties make money by referring customers to our
            Channels; · protect each party from errors, misuse of the Channels,
            fraud, or any criminal activity; · help us serve you better,
            including personalizing your shopping experience and tailoring
            content, recommendations, and offers we display to you, including
            advertisements, both on the Channels and elsewhere online; · improve
            the Channels or our products and services and for legal, regulatory
            and internal business purposes; · detect and troubleshoot problems,
            resolve disputes, and enforce applicable agreements and policies for
            the Channels; and · fulfill any other purpose consistent with this
            Privacy Policy or for purposes disclosed to you at the time of
            collection or with your consent. SHARING OF INFORMATION We may share
            non-personal information, such as Usage Information, hashed or
            otherwise de-identified data, and aggregated user statistics, with
            third parties in our discretion. We may share the information we
            have collected about you (including Personal Information) in the
            circumstances described below or elsewhere in this Privacy Policy,
            as disclosed at the time you provide information or otherwise with
            your consent. Affiliated and Unaffiliated Third Parties for Direct
            Marketing Amapola Escarlata may share your information, including
            Personal Information, with its and our affiliates and subsidiaries,
            for business, analytical, and operational purposes. We also share
            Personal Information with these affiliated companies so that they
            may contact you with their own direct marketing. We may share
            Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties as well (which
            may include advertising member networks and other data cooperatives)
            for their own direct marketing purposes and those of such
            unaffiliated third parties' own clients. You may opt out of our
            sharing Personal Information we have collected about you with third
            parties for their direct marketing purposes. Please note that if you
            have separately signed up to receive marketing communications from
            another brand, you will need to follow the opt-out procedures
            offered by that brand in order to stop receiving marketing messages
            from that brand. Using the affiliate opt-out feature described below
            will not affect your receipt of marketing messages from other brands
            that you have interacted with directly. And, if we have shared your
            information prior to you exercising your right to opt-out, you will
            need to opt-out directly with any third party who contacts you with
            marketing communications. Third Parties Providing Services on Our
            Behalf We may use third-party service providers to perform certain
            services on our behalf, such as hosting the Channels or Channel
            features, delivering packages, processing credit card payments,
            processing transactions and fulfilling orders, removing repetitive
            information from customer lists, providing customer service,
            providing website usage analytics, providing search results and
            links (including paid listings and links), providing targeted
            advertising, sending email, direct mail or other communications,
            providing marketing assistance and data analysis or enhancement, or
            performing other administrative services. One of these third-party
            service providers is Shopify. We may give these service providers
            access to your information (including Personal Information) so that
            they can carry out the services they are performing for you or for
            Amapola Escarlata. When You Agree to Receive Information from Third
            Parties or Request That We Share Your Information. You may be
            presented with an opportunity to receive information or marketing
            offers from one or more third parties. If you agree at that time to
            have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information
            will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be
            subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. We
            are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third
            parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive
            communications from a third party, you will need to contact that
            third party directly. You also may request, sometimes through your
            use of an interactive feature or third-party application, that we
            share information about you with a third party, and we will
            typically do so under those circumstances. Cobranded Credit Card
            Amapola Escarlata may share Personal Information and other
            information with the issuing bank for our Amapola Escarlata Credit
            Card, and its affiliates, for purposes related to the Amapola
            Escarlata Credit Card. For example, we may share information in
            order to send joint offerings, including information on how to apply
            for the Amapola Escarlata Credit Card, and in connection with your
            use of a Amapola Escarlata Credit Card, such as to maintain or
            service accounts and to effectuate transactions. We may also share
            information with these parties for analytics purposes. Other
            Cobranded Partners Cobranded partners are entities with whom we work
            to offer a service or feature. You can typically tell when you are
            accessing a service offered by a cobranded partner because the
            cobranded partner's name will be featured prominently. You may be
            asked to provide information about yourself to utilize a feature
            offered by a cobranded partner. In doing so, you may be providing
            your information to both us and to the cobranded partner, or we may
            share your information directly with the cobranded partner. Please
            note that the cobranded partner's policies will apply its collection
            and use of your information, not this policy. We may also offer
            scrip programs (which allow you to instruct us to divert a
            percentage of the amount you spend on purchases to participating
            schools and other non-profit organizations) or third-party loyalty
            programs (which allow you to earn "points" on purchases through a
            Channel and use the points toward certain rewards offered by the
            loyalty program). If we offer any scrip, loyalty, or similar program
            in which Amapola Escarlata is a participating vendor and you choose
            to participate, you authorize Amapola Escarlata or our payment
            processor to provide information about your purchases to the company
            administering the program. In such case, the information we will
            share with that program administrator may include your name, payment
            information, the date and amount of your purchase, and other
            information. Please note that once we disclose this information, the
            scrip or loyalty company may use and share it with others in
            accordance with its own privacy policy. We do not control the
            privacy practices of third parties and you should review the privacy
            policy of any scrip or loyalty partner or other cobranded partner
            before participating. Business Transfers and Transitions In the
            event Amapola Escarlata goes through a transition (such as a merger,
            acquisition, bankruptcy or sale of all or a portion of its assets,
            including, without limitation, during the course of any due
            diligence process), your information (including your Personal
            Information) will likely be among the assets transferred. By
            providing your Personal Information, you agree that we may transfer
            such information to the acquiring entity without your further
            consent. Sweepstakes, Contests, & Promotions We may offer
            sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a "Promotion")
            that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you
            are agreeing to the provisions, conditions, or official rules that
            govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of
            you (including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the
            sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or
            other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials). If
            you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be
            disclosed to third parties (including, without limitation, a
            co-sponsor) or the public in connection with the administration of
            such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with
            winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or
            permitted by the Promotion's terms or official rules (such as on a
            winners list). Administrative and Legal Reasons Amapola Escarlata
            reserves the right to use or disclose any information (including
            Personal Information) as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or
            legal request; to protect the integrity of the Channels; to fulfill
            your requests; to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation, an
            investigation on a public safety matter, or an investigation into
            claims of intellectual-property infringement; to protect and defend
            the legal rights or property of Amapola Escarlata, our parent
            company, affiliates and shareholders, any Channel or its users, or
            any other party; or, in an emergency, to protect the health and
            safety of our users or the general public. This includes exchanging
            information with other companies and organizations for fraud
            protection and credit risk reduction. Employment Applications. If
            you apply for a job through the Channels, we or our service
            provider(s) may ask you to provide self-identifying information
            (such as veteran status, gender, and ethnicity) in conjunction with
            laws and regulations enforced by, as applicable, the Equal
            Employment Opportunity Commission and other federal, state,
            provincial/territorial, and local regulatory agencies. Providing
            such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do
            provide such information, we and/or our service provider may submit
            that information to the appropriate government or regulatory
            agencies to fulfill reporting requirements and use that information
            to defend against employment-related complaints. THIRD-PARTY LINKS &
            CONTENT The Channels may link to or incorporate websites,
            advertising or content hosted and served by third parties over which
            we have no control and which are governed by the privacy policies
            and business practices of those third parties, including the bank
            that operates our private-label credit card program. Amapola
            Escarlata is not responsible for the privacy practices or business
            practices of any third party. ONLINE ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
            PROVIDERS We may work with network advertisers, ad agencies,
            analytics service providers, and other vendors to serve our
            advertisements on third-party websites, apps, and elsewhere online
            and to provide us with information regarding use of and traffic on
            the Channels (including without limitation the pages viewed and the
            actions users take when visiting the Channels) and the effectiveness
            of our advertisements. For example, if you click on an advertisement
            for Amapola Escarlata, our service provider(s) may be able to tell
            us the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the
            advertisement. The advertisements you see may be served by one or
            more third parties, who may use information about your activities on
            the Channels, and other websites and services you visit across the
            various devices you use, to provide you targeted advertising based
            upon your interests. Our service providers may collect certain
            information about your visits to and activity on the Channels and
            other websites and services and may use this information to target
            advertising to you. These service providers may set and access their
            own tracking technologies on your device (including without
            limitation cookies and web beacons) and may otherwise collect or
            have access to information about you (such as Usage Information and
            device identifier). Some of these parties may collect Personal
            Information over time when you visit the Channels or other online
            websites and services. Cookies and web beacons, including without
            limitation those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used
            to (among other things): target advertisements, prevent you from
            seeing the same advertisements too many times, and conduct research
            regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may
            share certain information such as device identifiers, Usage
            Information, records of transactions you conduct on our Channels or
            offline, and de-identified information with third-party advertising
            companies, analytics providers, and other vendors for advertising
            and analytics purposes. In addition, we and our third-party service
            providers may use this information to perform matching with
            third-party cookies in order to provide targeted online marketing.
            We use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and
            analytics services, and some of these companies may be members of
            the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or Digital Advertising
            Alliance ("DAA"). You may wish to visit
            optout.networkadvertising.org, which provides information regarding
            targeted advertising and the opt-out procedures of NAI members. You
            may also want to visit optout.aboutads.info, which provides
            information regarding targeted advertising and offers an opt-out for
            DAA-participating companies. We use Google Analytics, which uses
            cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information
            about use of the Channels and report on activities and trends. This
            service may also collect information regarding the use of other
            websites, apps, and online resources. You can learn about Google's
            practices by going to google.com/policies/privacy/partners, and opt
            out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser
            add-on, available at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. For mobile
            apps, you may be able to limit certain advertising practices using
            the settings on your phone, tablet or other mobile device. You may
            also download the AppChoices app at youradchoices.com/appchoices to
            opt out of the delivery of interest-based advertisements in
            participating mobile apps. Please note opting out through these
            mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You
            will continue to receive non-targeted advertisements while online.
            HOW WE RESPOND TO "DO NOT TRACK" SIGNALS Some Internet browsers may
            be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services
            that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as
            to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. other than that a
            response to a “Do Not Track” signal is voluntary. Like many websites
            and online services, our Channels do not alter their practices when
            they receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To
            find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit
            www.allaboutdnt.com. SECURITY We employ commercially reasonable
            security methods and technologies to help secure your Personal
            Information, including physical, technological, and organizational
            protections. However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure. We
            therefore cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
            that you transmit to us, or that we transmit to you, or guarantee
            that it will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. You
            use the Channels and provide us with information at your own
            initiative and risk. CONSENT TO TRANSFER AND STORAGE IN THE UNITED

            information may be subject to access requests from governments,
            courts, or law enforcement in the United States and other countries
            according to laws in those jurisdictions. ACCESSING AND UPDATING

            accordance with these procedures does not ensure complete or
            comprehensive removal of the content or information you posted,
            which may persist in archival records or may have been copied by
            third parties while publicly accessible. Amapola Escarlata will make
