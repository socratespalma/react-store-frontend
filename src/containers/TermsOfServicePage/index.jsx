            Amapola Escarlata WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL
            ARBITRATION. THAT MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY,
            WILL DECIDE ANY DISPUTE AND THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO BRING AN

            CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE, OR PRIVATE
            ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION OR ARBITRATION. Welcome to Amapola
            Escarlata. Please take a few minutes to review these Terms. Your use
            of the amapolaescarlata.com website or other websites, applications,
            or features Amapola Escarlata owns or controls on which we post a
            link to these Terms (collectively, "Amapola Escarlata Channels" or
            "our Channels"), regardless of how you access them, constitutes your
            agreement to follow these Terms and to be bound by them. IF YOU DO
            NOT AGREE, PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE USING OUR CHANNELS. In some
            instances, a separate document will provide supplemental conditions
            applicable to a service or product offered via our Channels
            ("Additional Terms"), in addition to these Terms. To the extent
            there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms,
            the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms
            expressly state otherwise. Please also review our Privacy Policy,
            which is also applicable to your use of our Channels. Use of our
            Channels is unauthorized in any jurisdiction where all or any
            portion of the Channels may violate any legal requirements, and you
            agree not to access the Channels in any such jurisdiction. You are
            responsible for compliance with applicable laws. Any use in
            contravention of this provision or any provision of these Terms is
            at your own risk. We reserve the right to refuse access to any user
            we determine, in our sole discretion, is not complying with these
            Terms, and to discontinue any of our Channels at any time for any
            reason. THESE TERMS MAY CHANGE Amapola Escarlata reserves the right
            to modify or add to these Terms at any time, effective as of the
            posting of the new terms or a later date as may be specified in the
            new terms. You agree that we may notify you of the new terms by
            making them available via our Channels, and that your use of our
            Channels after we post the new terms (or engaging in such other
            conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to
            the new terms. We therefore encourage you to review these Terms
            every time you use our Channels. ELIGIBILITY The Channels are not
            targeted towards, or intended for use by, anyone under the age of
            13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may only use the
            Channels under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who
            agrees to be bound by these Terms. By installing, accessing, or
            using the Channels, you represent that you are at least eighteen
            (18) years of age or the age of majority in your state of residence,
            or at least thirteen (13) years of age and under the supervision of
            a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. In
            addition, you agree to abide by all applicable local, state,
            national, and international laws and regulations with respect to
            your use of the Channels and agree not to interfere with the use and
            enjoyment of the Channels by other Users and Amapola Escarlata's
            operation or management of the Channels. REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT
            CREATION Amapola Escarlata may at times require that you register
            and/or set up an account to access or use certain portions of the
            Channel, or the Channel as a whole. The decision to provide the
            information necessary to do so is purely optional, but if you elect
            not to provide the required information, you may not be able to
            access or use certain materials or features of our Channels. When
            you provide information to us, you agree to provide only true,
            accurate, current, and complete information and to update it as
            necessary to maintain its truth and accuracy. With respect to any
            registration or account creation, you agree to: (a) create only one
            account; (b) provide accurate, truthful, current, and complete
            information when creating your account; (c) maintain and promptly
            update your account information; (d) maintain the security of your
            account by not sharing your user name or password with others and by
            restricting access to your account and the device(s) from which you
            access your account; (e) promptly notify Amapola Escarlata if you
            discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches relating to the
            Channels; and (f) take responsibility for all activities that occur
            under your account and accept all risks of unauthorized access. We
            may refuse to grant you, and you may not use, a user name or email
            address that is already being used by someone else; that may be
            construed as impersonating another person; that belongs to another
            person; that violates the intellectual property or other rights of
            any person; that is offensive; or that we reject for any other
            reason in our sole discretion. Your user name and password are for
            your personal use only. If you use the Channels, you may not
            authorize others to use your registration information or account,
            and you are responsible for your use and disclosure of the same.
            TERMINATION Amapola Escarlata reserves the right, without notice and
            in its sole discretion, to terminate your account or your use of the
            Channels, and to block or prevent future access to and use of the
            Channels if you violate any of these Terms. Upon any such
            termination, your right to use the Channels will immediately cease.
            You agree that any termination of your access to or use of the
            Channels may be effected without prior notice, and that we may
            immediately deactivate or delete your password and user name, and
            all related information and files associated with it, and/or bar any
            further access by you to such information or files. You agree that
            we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination
            of your access to the Channels or to any such information or files,
            and we shall not be required to make such information or files
            available to you after any such termination. Upon termination, all
            provisions of these Terms that are by their nature intended to
            survive termination, all representations and warranties, limitation
            of liabilities, and all indemnities shall survive such termination.

            may provide user comment areas, chat rooms, message boards,
            interactive user communities, or other areas on our Channels
            ("Community Forums") where users can engage in social networking,
            interact with others and with us, as well as have the opportunity to
            submit photographs, writings, music, video, audio recordings,
            computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions,
            or other content, including personal information (collectively,
            "User Submissions"). For each User Submission you send, post,
            upload, or otherwise make available to our Channels, you grant to
            Amapola Escarlata and its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates an
            irrevocable, worldwide, nonexclusive, perpetual, fully
            sub-licensable and assignable, royalty-free license to use, exploit,
            reproduce, modify, translate, incorporate in other works, create
            derivative works from, publish, broadcast, and perform that User
            Submission and your name, voice, likeness, and other identifying
            information in connection with that User Submission via any media
            now known or later developed, without any compensation or further
            notice to you. Representation and Warranty. By submitting a User
            Submission, you represent and warrant that: You are the sole author
            and owner of the intellectual property and other rights thereto;
            Subject to applicable laws, all "moral rights" that you may have in
            such content have been voluntarily waived by you, even if the User
            Submission is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you;
            All content that you post is honest, accurate and not misleading;
            You will not impersonate any other person, user or company or upload
            or post User Submissions that you know are false, fraudulent,
            deceptive, inaccurate, misleading or that misrepresents your
            identity or affiliation with a person or company; Use of the content
            you supply does not violate these Terms and will not cause injury to
            any person or entity; Your User Submission relates to the content on
            our Channels and is intended to add to the discussion and community
            on our Channels and does not include irrelevant topics or postings
            (this is not the place to discuss politics, religion, or private
            matters); Your User Submission is not for commercial purposes and
            does not advertise or promote a product or service except those
            provided on our Channels; You will be respectful of others' opinions
            and comments so we can continue to build a Community Forum for
            everyone to enjoy. If you think your User Submission might offend
            someone, chances are it probably will and it does not belong on a
            Community Forum; AND Your User Submission is suitable for a public
            forum. You further agree and warrant that you will not submit any
            User Submission: That infringes any third party's copyright, patent,
            trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of
            publicity or privacy; That violates any law, statute, ordinance,
            rule or regulation (including, but not limited to, those governing
            export control, consumer protection, unfair competition,
            anti-discrimination or false advertising); That is, or may
            reasonably be considered to be, defamatory, libelous, indecent,
            obscene, hateful, racially or religiously biased or offensive,

            threatening to any individual, partnership or corporation, or
            negative toward or connected to national origin, gender, sexual
            preference or physical handicap. Cursing, stalking, posting
            insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip or similar actions are
            prohibited and your User Submission may not threaten abuse or harm
            others; That includes any information that references other
            websites, or personal information about you or another person (e.g.,
            full name, password, phone number, address, e-mail address,
            financial information, other personally identifiable information or
            contact information, or information that may be used to track,
            contact, or impersonate that individual or that is extremely
            personal in nature); That contains any computer viruses, worms or
            other potentially damaging computer or electronic programs, code or
            files; or That promotes violence or describes how to perform a
            violent act. Please remember that each Community Forum is a public
            forum and any User Submission that you post on a Community Forum
            will be accessible and viewable by other users. All User Submissions
            that you submit may be used at our sole discretion. We do not
            guarantee that you will have any recourse through our Channels to
            edit or delete any content you have submitted. You acknowledge that
            you, not Amapola Escarlata, are responsible for the content of your
            User Submission. Neither we nor the Amapola Escarlata Affiliates are
            responsible for, and we do not endorse, any User Submission posted
            in Community Forums or elsewhere on our Channels. No Obligation to
            Prescreen/Monitor. We do not have, and do not undertake, any
            obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any User
            Submission. However, we retain the right (but not the obligation),
            in our sole discretion and for any reason, to prescreen, monitor,
            edit, refuse to accept, post, remove, or move any User Submission.
            Because we may not prescreen User Submissions, if your User
            Submission contains offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable
            content, or infringes on the rights of any third parties, you may
            bear legal responsibility for that User Submission. You agree that
            Amapola Escarlata has no obligation to monitor or enforce your
            intellectual property rights to your User Submission, but has the
            right to protect and enforce its and its licensors' licensed rights
            to your User Submission. No Confidential Relationship, Compensation,
            or Liability. Except as may otherwise be described in our Privacy
            Policy, any User Submission will be treated as non-confidential and
            non-proprietary, and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure
            of any User Submission. You acknowledge and agree that your
            relationship with us is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type
            of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any User
            Submission does not place Amapola Escarlata in a position that is
            any different from the position held by members of the general
            public, including with regard to your User Submission. None of your
            User Submissions will be subject to any obligation of confidence on
            the part of Amapola Escarlata, and we will not be liable for any use
            or disclosure of any User Submission that you provide. You agree
            that if you submit content, information, ideas, suggestions,
            designs, or other materials to Amapola Escarlata, those materials
            are submitted voluntarily. You also understand and acknowledge that:
            (a) Amapola Escarlata has wide access to content, information,
            ideas, suggestions, designs, and other materials that may be similar
            or identical to materials you submit to us; (b) you will not be
            entitled to any compensation (nor will Amapola Escarlata be
            obligated to negotiate with you) as a result of our use of any
            similar or identical material; and (c) we do not now and will not
            have in the future any duty or liability, direct or indirect,
            vicarious, contributory, or otherwise, with respect to the
            infringement or protection of your rights in and to any materials
            you submit to us. No Obligation to Use. You agree and understand
            that we are not obligated to post, keep, or use your User
            Submission. SCREEN SHARING SERVICE As a convenience to you, Amapola
            Escarlata may offer you the ability to allow a Amapola Escarlata
            Customer Service Representative to view what is on your device
            screen for purposes of helping you on our Channels. Your
            participation in that service is subject to these Terms, and is
            voluntary. The service can be initiated only by you. If you agree to
            screen sharing, a Amapola Escarlata Customer Service Representative
            is able to access and view any data and applications present on your
            device screen at that time. Please close out of any confidential or
            other sensitive data or information prior to consenting to share
            your screen. You may close your screen-sharing session at any time
            by clicking the disconnect button in the screen share window or by
            closing your browser window. Note that we cannot guarantee that the
            provision of this service will resolve your issue or that the
            service will always be available. Also note that the screen share
            service is not the same as allowing technical support for or control
            over your device, and therefore, you remain solely responsible for
            all actions taken on your device. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENT
            From time to time, our Channels may contain third party content, or
            links to websites, services, or other resources owned or operated by

            WAIVER/DISPUTE RESOLUTION PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS
            YOUR RIGHTS. Summary Most or your concerns can be resolved quickly
            to your satisfaction by contacting our Customer Service Center. In
            the unlikely event that Customer Service cannot resolve your
            complaint to your satisfaction, or if we have not been able to
            resolve a dispute with you after trying to do so informally, we each
            agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration rather
            than in court. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit.
            Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury,
            allows less discovery than courts, and is subject to very limited
            court review. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will serve
            as the arbitration provider. We agree that any arbitration under
            these Terms will take place on an individual basis. Representative,
            group, collective or class actions or arbitrations are not
            permitted. As explained below, if you prevail in arbitration,
            Amapola Escarlata may pay you more than the amount of the
            arbitrator's award and will pay your actual, reasonable attorney's
            fees if you are awarded an amount greater than what Amapola
            Escarlata offered you to settle the dispute before arbitration. You
            may speak with your own lawyer before using this Website or
            purchasing any product or service, but your use of this Website and
            the purchase of any product or service constitutes your agreement to
            these Terms. Arbitration Agreement: Amapola Escarlata and you agree
            to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us before a single
            arbitrator. The kinds of disputes and claims we agree to arbitrate
            are intended to be broadly interpreted, including but not limited
            to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the
            relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
            fraud, misrepresentation, advertising, or any other legal theory;
            claims that arose before these or any prior Terms became effective;
            claims that are currently the subject of purported class action
            litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
            claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. For the
            purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to "Amapola
            Escarlata," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries,
            affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors,
            and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or
            beneficiaries of Website and our products and services under these
            Terms or any prior agreements between us. This arbitration agreement
            does not preclude your bringing issues to the attention of federal,
            state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek
            relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into
            these Terms, you and Amapola Escarlata are each WAIVING THE RIGHT TO
            A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A REPRESENTATIVE, GROUP,
            COLLECTIVE OR CLASS ACTION OR ARBITRATION. You acknowledge that use
            of this Website and/or purchase of products or services constitutes
            a transaction in interstate commerce. The Federal Arbitration Act
            (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
            Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement survives
            termination of these Terms. A party seeking arbitration under these
            Terms must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of
            Dispute ("Notice") to the other party. A Notice to Amapola Escarlata
            should be addressed to: [addressee and address, Attn: Notice of
            Dispute (the "Notice Address"). Amapola Escarlata may send a written
            Notice to the electronic mail address that you provided when you
            created an account, if any. The Notice must (a) describe the nature
            and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific
            relief sought ("Demand"). If Amapola Escarlata and you do not reach
            an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is
            received, you or Amapola Escarlata may commence an arbitration
            proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
            offer made by Amapola Escarlata or you shall not be disclosed to the
            arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any,
            to which you or we is entitled. You may download or copy a form to
            initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association
            (“AAA”) website at:
            http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820. (There is a
            separate form for California residents, also available on the AAA's
            website at: http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) After
            Amapola Escarlata receives notice at the Notice Address that you
            have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your
            payment of the filing fee, unless your total claim is for more than
            $75,000. If your total claim exceeds $75,000, the payment of all
            arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA rules. The filing fee
            for consumer-initiated arbitration is currently $300, but this is
            subject to change by AAA, the arbitration provider. If you are
            unable to pay this fee and your total claim is for $75,000 or less,
            Amapola Escarlata will pay the filing fee directly after receiving a
            written request at the Notice Address. Except as otherwise provided
            herein, Amapola Escarlata will pay all AAA filing, administration,
            and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with
            these Terms. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the
            substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
            frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
            standards in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the
            payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such
            case, you agree to reimburse the AIC for all monies previously
            disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the
            AAA Rules. d. All arbitration proceedings will be governed by the
            Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary
            Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively,
            the "AAA Rules"), as modified by these Terms, and will be
            administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at
            www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator
            is bound by these Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to
            decide, except that issues relating to the scope, enforceability,
            and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope,
            enforceability, and interpretation of paragraph (f) are for the
            court to decide. e. Unless Amapola Escarlata and you agree
            otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county or
            parish of the contact address you submitted to us. If your total
            claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration
            will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
            arbitrator, by a telephone hearing, or by an in-person hearing
            governed by the AAA Rules. If you choose to proceed either by
            telephone or in person, we may choose to respond only by written or
            telephonic response. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules
            will determine whether you have a right to a telephone or in-person
            hearing. The parties agree that in any arbitration under these
            Terms, neither party will rely on any award or finding of fact or
            conclusion of law made in any other arbitration to which Company was
            a party. In all cases, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned,
            written decision sufficient to explain the findings of fact and
            conclusions of law on which the award is based. f. If the arbitrator
            finds in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, and
            the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of
            our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was
            selected, then Amapola Escarlata will pay you either the amount of
            the award or $2,000 ("the Alternative Payment"), whichever is
            greater, plus the actual amount of reasonable attorney's fees and
            expenses that you incurred in investigating, preparing, and pursuing
            your claim in arbitration (the "Attorney's Payment"). If we did not
            make you a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator
            was selected, you will be entitled to receive the Alternative
            Payment and the Attorney's Payment, respectively, if the arbitrator
            awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings
            and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees,
            expenses, and the Alternative Payment and the Attorney's Payment at
            any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party
            made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. In
            assessing whether an award that includes attorney’s fees or expenses
            is greater than the value of Amapola Escarlata’s last written
            settlement offer, the arbitrator shall consider only the actual
            attorney’s fees or expenses reasonably incurred before Amapola
            Escarlata’s settlement offer. g. The right to attorney's fees and
            expenses discussed in paragraph (f) supplements any right to
            attorney's fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. If
            you would be entitled to a larger amount under applicable law, this
            provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that
            amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of
            attorney's fees or costs. Although under some laws Amapola Escarlata
            may have a right to an award of attorney's fees and expenses from
            you if it prevails in an arbitration, we will not seek such an
            award. h. The arbitrator may award monetary and injunctive relief
            only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the
            extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's
            individual claim. YOU AND Amapola Escarlata AGREE THAT EACH MAY
            BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
            CAPACITIES AND NOT AS PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED
            REPRESENTATIVE, GROUP OR CLASS ACTION OR ARBITRATION, OR IN THE
            CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Further, unless both you and
            Amapola Escarlata agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
            consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise
            preside over any form of a representative, group or class
            proceeding. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could
            award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect
            other customers. Neither you nor we may seek non-individualized
            relief that would affect other customers. If a court decides that
            applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's
            limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim
            (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may
            be brought in court. All other claims remain subject to this
            Arbitration Agreement. i. If the total amount in dispute exceeds
            $75,000 or either party seeks any form of injunctive relief, either
            party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered
            by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from
            the date of entry of the written arbitration award. An award of
            injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal. The
            members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to
            AAA rules. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within
            one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing
            party's notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel
            shall be final and binding, subject to any right of judicial review
            that exists under the FAA. j. Notwithstanding any provision in these
            Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any material change
            to this arbitration provision (other than a change to any notice
            address, website link or telephone number), that change will not
            apply to any dispute of which we had written notice on the effective
            date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this
            arbitration provision, any such termination will not be effective
            until at least thirty (30) days after written notice of such
            termination is provided to you, and shall not be effective as to
            disputes which arose prior to the date of termination. k.
            Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, either
            party may bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In no event
            will you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive or other
            equitable relief or to enjoin or restrain the operation or
            exploitation of these Terms or the Channels. SEVERABILITY AGREEMENT
            If any provision of the Agreement is found by a court or other
            binding authority to be invalid, you agree that every attempt shall
            be made to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
            that provision, and the remaining provisions contained in this
            Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. ELECTRONIC
